# tortoise-and-the-hare
Implementation of the tortoise and the hare algorithm for finding cycles in a data structure (linked this in this case).  I came upon the  algorithm in Kent Dybvig's "The Scheme Programming Language" book.  The implementation here is my C++ version of what I remember of the Scheme version in the book.

Wikipedia credits the algorithm to Robert W. Floyd:
